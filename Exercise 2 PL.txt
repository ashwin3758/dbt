1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for
example, between 1 and 10).

if done then
leave cursor_c;
end if;

if(i between x and y) then
insert into tempp(result,value) values ('in range',i);
else
insert into tempp(result,value) values ('not in range',i);
end if;
end loop cursor_c;

2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and
determine whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two
sides must always be greater than the third side.


3. Check if a given a year is a leap year. The condition is:- year should be (divisible by 4
and not divisible by 100) or (divisible by 4 and divisible by 400.). The year should be
Selected from some table.
4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings. Your program should
then determine if one character string exists inside another character string.
